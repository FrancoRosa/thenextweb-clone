# thenextweb-clone
In this project, we build a responsive website. We‚Äôll be cloning The Next Web which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

## In this project we managed to do the following:
1. Create navbar with fixed position
1.1. Necessary element pop-up and disappear on change of screen size
2. The main section is using grid
2.1. Background of the main sections are using gradient and background image
2.2. Responsiveness is applied for smaller screens
3. Changing display properties on elements
3.1. 3-4 column grid for wider than 1024, 3 column grid for less 
3.2. and 1 column for mobile or display block in some situations
4. Managed to create special bullet points on list elements
5. Almost none of the elements is using fixed width or height.
